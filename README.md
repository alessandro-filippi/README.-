About me
My primary focus is driving revenue, which is the most crucial metric. Over the past twenty years, I have designed technology solutions and pioneered SEO strategies for online casinos and hospitality to both big brands and startups across international markets. I champion the 'what if?' mindset, harnessing my combined expertise in software development, search engine optimization (SEO), and digital strategy to deliver outstanding outcomes.

I specialize in search engine optimization (SEO), digital strategy, online casino, management reputation and software development, data analysis with a focus on natural language processing and computational ontologies, and search marketing automation.
